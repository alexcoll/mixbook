Problem Statement:
No drink beats a well mixed cocktail at your favorite bar. However, what if you don’t want to leave your house or pay $10 for drinks that you can make yourself for the fraction of the cost? You could mix your own drinks at home, but you’re not a bartender: you don’t know what drinks you can make with what you have in your kitchen. Our mixology app aims to solve that problem: give it a list of ingredients and Mixbook will give you detailed recipes using only those ingredients. Currently there are a multitude of mixology apps that just solely list recipes. Our application serves to create a social media where users can share recipes and review drinks through a simple user interface.
